# ⚡ StdAPI

> One backend. Real APIs. Built for developers who actually ship.

StdAPI is a **backend-first API platform** that centralizes
high-utility developer APIs into one **clean, stable, predictable system**.

No frontend gimmicks.  
No fake “AI startup” drama.  
Just APIs you actually use in real projects.

---

## ❓ What is StdAPI?

StdAPI is designed to be the **last backend utility layer** you need.

Instead of:
- wiring dozens of random APIs
- copy-pasting bot logic
- rewriting the same backend again & again

StdAPI gives you **one standard backend** for automation, AI, media, and search.

---

## 🧠 Why StdAPI exists

Most developers face the same pain repeatedly:

- ❌ Too many random APIs for basic tasks  
- ❌ Unstable free services  
- ❌ Same logic rewritten in every bot or script  
- ❌ Different auth, limits, formats everywhere  

StdAPI fixes this by **standardizing the boring stuff — once**.

## 🧰 What lives inside StdAPI?

Only **work-grade APIs** — nothing else.

- 🤖 AI chat & automation (g4f)
- 🎬 Media & video tools (yt-dlp)
- 🔍 Search & knowledge utilities
- 🧩 Helper APIs for bots & scripts

If an API doesn’t help:
- VS Code scripts  
- Telegram bots  
- Automation workflows  

…it does **not** belong here.

## 🧱 Architecture (High Level)


Designed so **complexity does not grow with features**.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

StdAPI is built like infrastructure.

- Predictable APIs
- Stable behavior
- No random breaking changes
- Backend-first (no frontend dependency)

If an API does **not solve a real developer problem**,  
it does not belong in StdAPI.

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

StdAPI is built for:

- Telegram bots
- Automation scripts
- Backend utilities
- AI-powered services
- Internal tools & experiments

If it runs on a server, StdAPI fits.

## 🛣 Roadmap (Simple & Honest)

- Phase 1 — Core APIs (AI, media, search)
- Phase 2 — 30 high-utility endpoints
- Phase 3 — Stability & performance
- Phase 4 — Community contributions

Growth is **planned**, not rushed.
