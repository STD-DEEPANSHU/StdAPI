What is StdAPI?

StdAPI is a backend-first API platform that provides a standardized interface for commonly required developer capabilities such as AI interactions, media handling, search utilities, and automation tasks.

The goal is simple:

Reduce backend complexity by replacing dozens of fragmented APIs with one consistent platform.

StdAPI is not built to impress —
it is built to stay reliable when projects grow.

The Problem StdAPI Solves

Most developers face the same issues again and again:

Too many APIs for basic tasks

Inconsistent request / response formats

Fragile integrations that break over time

Different auth, limits, and behaviors everywhere

StdAPI approaches this from a systems perspective, not a feature checklist.

Design Principles

StdAPI follows a few strict principles:

Consistency over quantity

Backend-first architecture (no frontend dependency)

Predictable APIs that don’t change randomly

Practical features only — no novelty endpoints

Scalable by design, not patched later

If an API does not solve a real developer problem, it does not belong here.

What StdAPI Is (and is not)

StdAPI is:

A unified backend platform

Suitable for bots, tools, scripts, and services

Designed to scale from small projects to large systems

StdAPI is not:

A UI framework

A demo playground

A collection of gimmick APIs

Core Capability Areas (Phase-based)

StdAPI is developed incrementally.

Early phases focus on APIs that developers actually use daily, such as:

Conversational and text-based tools

Media handling and processing

Knowledge and search utilities

Automation and developer helpers

Each capability follows the same structure, auth model, and response format.

Architecture Overview
StdAPI/
├── core/        # shared infrastructure & rules
├── ai/          # conversational & text APIs
├── media/       # media-related APIs
├── search/      # search & knowledge APIs
├── automation/  # utilities & helpers
└── api/         # HTTP interface layer


The system is intentionally modular so that complexity does not grow with features.

Roadmap Philosophy

StdAPI does not chase numbers.

APIs are added only when they are stable and justified

Backward compatibility is treated seriously

The platform is expected to run long-term without rewrites

Growth is planned, not rushed.

StdAPI is built with a single goal:

Make backend development boring — because boring systems scale best.
