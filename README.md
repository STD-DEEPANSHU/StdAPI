🚀 What is StdAPI?

StdAPI is a backend-first API platform
designed to centralize high-utility developer APIs under one clean system.

No frontend gimmicks.
No fake “AI startup” drama.
Just APIs you actually use.

🧩 Why StdAPI exists

Most developers face the same pain:

🟥 Too many random APIs
🟥 Unstable free services
🟥 Copy-paste bot code
🟥 Same logic rewritten again & again

StdAPI fixes this by standardizing the boring stuff.

🛠 What lives inside StdAPI?

Only work-grade APIs — nothing else.

• AI chat & automation (g4f)
• Media & video tools (yt-dlp)
• Search & knowledge utilities
• Helper APIs for bots & scripts


If it doesn’t help:

VS Code scripts

Telegram bots

Backend automation

👉 it doesn’t belong here.

🧠 Design Philosophy

StdAPI is built like infrastructure, not a demo.

✔ Backend-first
✔ Predictable responses
✔ Minimal surface area
✔ Stable interfaces
✔ Long-term support mindset


No breaking changes just to look cool.

🏗 Architecture (high-level)
stdapi/
 ├─ core/        → shared logic & rules
 ├─ ai/          → chat & intelligence
 ├─ media/       → video / download tools
 ├─ search/      → search & knowledge
 ├─ automation/  → helpers & utilities
 └─ api/         → HTTP layer (FastAPI)


Modular by design.
Scales without turning ugly.

⚙️ Who should use this?

✔ Backend developers
