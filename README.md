## What is StdAPI?

StdAPI is a **developer-focused API platform** that brings together
commonly used backend capabilities under a single, consistent system.

Instead of juggling multiple services, formats, and auth methods,
StdAPI provides **one place** to access powerful APIs in a predictable way.

Built for:
- developers
- students
- automation builders
- bot creators

---

## Why use StdAPI?

Most projects end up needing the same things:

- chat & text processing  
- media handling  
- search & information APIs  
- utilities for bots and scripts  

StdAPI simplifies this by offering:
- a single API base
- consistent responses
- stable endpoints
- easy integration

No setup headaches. No scattered tools.

---

## What can you build with it?

StdAPI is suitable for:

- 🤖 Telegram bots  
- 🛠 automation scripts  
- 🌐 backend services  
- 🧪 experiments & tools  
- 📦 internal utilities  

If your project talks to an API, StdAPI can power it.

---

## How it works (high level)

- One API base URL
- Clear, grouped endpoints
- JSON in / JSON out
- Designed to be simple to consume from any language

You don’t need to know how things work internally —
just use the API.

---

## Documentation

- Interactive API docs (Swagger UI)
- Clear endpoint descriptions
- Example requests & responses

Documentation is designed to be **readable first**, not flashy.

---

## Stability & Growth

StdAPI is built with long-term use in mind:

- APIs are added carefully
- Breaking changes are avoided
- Focus stays on usefulness, not quantity

This is a growing platform, but not a rushed one.
